# Certificate Sorter
Reads the certificate files with .txt extension and prints on the console which file contains the root certificate and which contains User certificate

# Getting Started
- Change the directory location in the App.Config file to point to the folder containing the .txt certificate files
- F5 to run the solution

## Notes
- The POC reads certificate data from .txt files, but the X509Certificate object can be constructed in multiple ways
